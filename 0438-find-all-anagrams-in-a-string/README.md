## 🎯 Problem summary

<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/">438. Find All Anagrams in a String</a></h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><p>Given two strings <code>s</code> and <code>p</code>, return an array of all the start indices of <code>p</code>&#39;s <span data-keyword="anagram">anagrams</span> in <code>s</code>. You may return the answer in <strong>any order</strong>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;cbaebabacd&quot;, p = &quot;abc&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> [0,6]
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
The substring with start index = 0 is &quot;cba&quot;, which is an anagram of &quot;abc&quot;.
The substring with start index = 6 is &quot;bac&quot;, which is an anagram of &quot;abc&quot;.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;abab&quot;, p = &quot;ab&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> [0,1,2]
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
The substring with start index = 0 is &quot;ab&quot;, which is an anagram of &quot;ab&quot;.
The substring with start index = 1 is &quot;ba&quot;, which is an anagram of &quot;ab&quot;.
The substring with start index = 2 is &quot;ab&quot;, which is an anagram of &quot;ab&quot;.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= s.length, p.length &lt;= 3 * 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>s</code> and <code>p</code> consist of lowercase English letters.</li>
</ul>


### Given, return & examples

Use the original problem statement above as the source of truth. Add a representative example and the key constraints when reviewing this question.

## 📌 Constraints

- Add the constraints that influence the approach.
- Record any sortedness, uniqueness, or range guarantees.

        len_s , len_p = len(s) ,len(p)
        output = []

            return output
        
        expexted_freq, window_freq = [0]* 26, [0]* 26
        for c in p:
            expexted_freq[ord(c) - ord('a') ] += 1

        left = 0 
        right = 0
        
        while right < len_s:
            window_freq[ord( s[right] ) - ord('a') ] += 1
            
            if  right - left +1 == len_p:
                if expexted_freq == window_freq:
                    output.append(left)
                window_freq[ord(s[left]) - ord('a')] -= 1
                left +=1
            right +=1
        return output
